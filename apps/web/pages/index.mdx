# Evolu - React Hooks for Local-First Apps

React Hooks library for [local-first apps](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) with end-to-end encrypted backup and sync using [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) and [CRDT](https://crdt.tech/).

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Evolu is designed for privacy, ease of use, and no vendor lock-in.
</Callout>

Local-first apps allow users to own their data. Evolu stores data in the user's device(s), so Evolu apps can work offline and without a specific server. [Evolu Server](docs/evolu-server)

Evolu merges data changes made on different devices without conflicts using Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT). [How Evolu Works](docs/how-evolu-works)

## Overview

```js copy
import { createHooks, model } from "evolu";

// Define table ID branded type.
const TodoId = model.id<"todo">();

// Define DB schema and create React Hooks.
const { useQuery, useMutation } = createHooks({
  todo: {
    id: TodoId,
    // NonEmptyString1000 is much better than just a string.
    title: model.NonEmptyString1000,
    isCompleted: model.SqliteBoolean,
  },
});

// Evolu uses Kysely, a type-safe TypeScript SQL query builder.
const { rows, isLoaded } = useQuery((db) =>
  // createAt is added automatically.
  db.selectFrom("todo").select(["id", "title"]).orderBy("createdAt")
);

const { mutate } = useMutation();
// Mutate never fails. It's the advantage of branded types and local first apps.
mutate("todo", { id, isCompleted: true });
```
