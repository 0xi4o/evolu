# Why Evolu?

Evolu is a library for local-first apps, so the question should be,
why local-first apps?

## Why local-first apps?

Local-first apps allow users to own their data. Evolu stores data in the user's
device(s), so Evolu apps can work offline and without a specific server.

How is it different from keeping files on disk? Files are not the right abstraction
for apps and are complicated to synchronize among devices. That's why client-server
architecture rules the world. But as with everything, it has trade-offs.

## The trade-offs of the client-server architecture

Client-server architecture provides us with easy backup and synchronization,
but all that depends on the ability of a server to fulfill its promises.
Internet is offline, companies go bankrupt, users are banned, and errors occur.
All those things happen all the time, and then what? Right, that's why
the world needs local-first apps. But until now, writing local-first apps
has been challenging because of the lack of libraries and design patterns.
That's why I created Evolu.
