# useEvoluError

`useEvoluError` React Hook returns `EvoluError`.

Evolu should never fail; that's one of the advantages of local-first apps,
but if an error still occurs, please report it in Evolu GitHub issues.

The reason why Evolu should never fail is that there is no reason it should.
Mutations are saved immediately and synced when the internet is available.
The only expectable error is QuotaExceeded (TODO).
