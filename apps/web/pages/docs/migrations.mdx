# Migrations

Traditional server databases are versioned and migrated with migration scripts.
However, that's not practical with local-first databases replicated across
devices because Evolu apps must be able to handle data not only already made
but also data that will be made in the future. An outdated Evolu app version
must be able to handle data made on newer versions. Luckily, with two
simple rules, Evolu does that automatically.

<Callout>
  Evolu embraces schemaless design. It's similar to GraphQL [best
  practices](https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/#versioning) with few
  improvements we can afford because Evolu Server is generic for all Evolu apps
  (it knows nothing about Evolu apps schemas), and the database is local. Evolu
  can filter rows with nullable columns and narrow their types so developers
  don't have to deal with nullable values in their code.
</Callout>

## Append only schema

The first and most important rule is "append only schema." Once an app is
released, we can't change the existing database schema. We can't rename a
table, we can't rename a column, and we can't change a column type because
there is a chance some data has already been made. All we can do is stop
using them in new mutations, and that's fine.

## Nullability

While we can and should define non-nullable column types, and those types are
enforced on mutations, all columns except for `id` are nullable for queries.
That's because Evolu apps must properly handle all data regardless of when
they were made.

Imagine replacing a column `address` with the new column `addressId`
(foreign key) in the table schema. What should an outdated app do when
it gets new data? It should store data but not use them because it has
no code related to them until the app is updated. And that's what Evolu does.
Evolu updates the SQLite database ad-hoc, and with nullable columns for
queries, it forces developers to filter rows that the app can handle.

Take a look at this schema, mutation, and query.

```ts
const TodoTable = table({
  id: TodoId,
  // The title is not nullable.
  title: NonEmptyString1000,
});

// Mutations enforce required columns.
evolu.create("todo", { title });

// But in queries, all columns (except for `id`) are nullable
// until we explicitly filter and narrow them.
const allTodos = evolu.createQuery((db) =>
  db
    .selectFrom("todo")
    .selectAll()
    // Filter null value and ensure non-null type.
    .where("title", "is not", null)
    .$narrowType<{ title: NonEmptyString1000 }>()
    .orderBy("createdAt"),
);
```

Now, what if we decide we don't want the title anymore? Make it nullable,
but remember, there is a chance it's already used, so queries should still use it.

```ts
const TodoTable = table({
  id: TodoId,
  // Deprecated. Use the content instead.
  title: S.nullable(NonEmptyString1000),
  content: RichTextMax10k,
});

const allTodos = evolu.createQuery((db) =>
  db
    .selectFrom("todo")
    .selectAll()
    .where((eb) =>
      // The app has to use both title and content, depending on what is available.
      eb("title", "is not", null).or(eb("content", "is not", null)),
    )
    .orderBy("createdAt"),
);
```

Ideally, we would like to tell somehow that the title column was replaced with
column content and have access to both with union type:

```ts
type TitleOrContent =
  | { _tag: "title"; value: NonEmptyString1000 }
  | { _tag: "content"; value: RichTextMax10k };
```

Such a DSL for ad-hoc migrations is not available yet, but it's possible
with the power of Kysely and SQLite, and we plan to make it soon.

The last question: because `RichTextMax10k` can be a JSON, should we version it?
Yes, because while we can version it via name (content2, content3), it may be
used elsewhere in the database schema, and then we want to have a version
explicitly defined on the `RichTextMax10k` type itself.
