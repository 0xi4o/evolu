# Evolu Server

Evolu Server provides sync and backup for Evolu clients. It's a simple
message buffer; therefore, it's generic (the same) for all local-first
applications.

Not having to write and maintains specific server significantly improves
the developer experience. Just write the client code without spending
precious time on the server REST/GraphQL/whatever APIs.

Evolu server is open-sourced, and anyone can (but doesn't have to) run
their own.
