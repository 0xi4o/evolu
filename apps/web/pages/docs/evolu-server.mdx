# Evolu Server

Evolu Server provides sync and backup for Evolu clients. While it's technically
possible to sync and backup Evolu devices among themselves (P2P), it's not
practical because devices are often offline and geographically close. Backups
should be stored in locations that are geographically distant from each other
to ensure protection against localized disasters.

Evolu Server is a simple message buffer and storage generic (the same) for all
Evolu apps. Only UserId, NodeId, and messages timestamps are visible. Everything
else is encrypted.

Evolu server is [open-sourced](https://github.com/evoluhq/evolu/tree/main/packages/evolu-server),
and anyone can easily run their own. The core logic is a SQL database and
web framework agnostic, so it's highly portable.

  We provide a free `evolu.world` server built on the Cloudflare Workers and D1
  database for testing and personal usage. Our super secret master plan on how
  to make money on that is simple: We will sell hardware.
