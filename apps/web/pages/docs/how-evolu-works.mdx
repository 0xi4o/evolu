# How Evolu Works

Evolu is simple. That's the feature, not a bug. It's based on James Long's
[CRDTs for Mortals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEcwa68f-jY) talk.
I recommend you to watch it. James also made a
[working example](https://github.com/jlongster/crdt-example-app), and someone
very well [explained it](https://github.com/steida/crdt-example-app_annotated/blob/master/NOTES.md).
I took that code and improved it for production.

So, how does Evolu work? Evolu creates SQLite database in the user device and stores
all data locally. While we have full SQL for reads, writes must be written
in a special form to sync data among devices safely and without merge conflicts.
Every DB change is described as a CRDT message.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  CRDT stands for "Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type." It is a type of data
  structure used in distributed computing and distributed databases to enable
  concurrent updates to data without conflicts or the need for centralized
  coordination. CRDTs are designed to work in scenarios where multiple replicas
  of data exist in a distributed system, and these replicas can be updated
  independently and concurrently.
</Callout>

Evolu creates and stores CRDT messages locally and derives actual DB from them.
The most simple CRDT mutation (and the only one implemented right now) is the
last write win. Table, row, column, and new value. And a timestamp because
every CRDT message has to have a timestamp to ensure globally stable ordering
via [hybrid logical clocks](https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/hybrid-logical-clocks/).
