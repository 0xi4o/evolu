# How Evolu Works

## Local-first apps

Local-first apps allow users to own their data. Evolu stores data in the
user's device(s), so Evolu apps can work offline and without a specific
server. How is it different from keeping files on disk? Files are not
the right abstraction for apps and are complicated to synchronize
among devices. That's why client-server architecture rules the world.
But as with everything, it has trade-offs.

### The trade-offs of the client-server architecture

Client-server architecture provides us with easy backup and synchronization,
but all that depends on the ability of a server to fulfill its promises.
Internet is offline, companies go bankrupt, users are banned, and errors
occur. All those things happen all the time, and then what? Right,
that's why the world needs local-first apps. But until now, writing
local-first apps has been challenging because of the lack of libraries
and design patterns.
