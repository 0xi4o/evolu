# FAQ

## Is Evolu ready for production?

Yes. Evolu is stable and backward compatible from version one.

## I see a major version without a breaking change. Why?

Evolu is stable and backward compatible from version one. The reason for a major
version without a breaking change is that the Changeset, a tool for automatic
releases Evolu is using, releases a major change if some peer dependency has
a minor change to maintain compatibility with old NPM versions.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Local-first software has to be backward compatible forever, and Evolu is
  designed to embrace this requirement.
</Callout>

If you see a new major version, it means some peer dependency has a new feature.
Nothing more. It's common for React, Next.js, and other libraries and frameworks.
