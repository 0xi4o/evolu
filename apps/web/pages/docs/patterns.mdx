## Deferred Sync with Local-Only Tables

Tables with a name prefixed with `_` are local only, which means they are never
synced. It's useful for device-specific or temporal data.

Imagine editing a JSON representing a rich-text formatted document. Syncing the
whole document on every change would be inefficient. The ideal solution could
be to use some advanced CRDT logic, for example, the
[Peritext](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext), but a reliable implementation
doesn't exist yet.

Fortunately, we can leverage Evolu's local-only tables instead. Saving huge
JSON on every keystroke isn't an issue because Evolu uses Web Workers,
so saving doesn't block the main thread. In React Native, we use
`InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions` (soon).

When we decide it's time to sync, we move data from the local-only table to the
regular table. There is no API for that; just set `isDeleted` to `true` and insert
data into a new table. Evolu batches mutations in microtask and runs it within a
transaction, so there is no chance for data loss.

```ts
// Both `update` and `create` run within a transaction.
evolu.update("_todo", { id: someId, isDeleted: true });
// This mutation starts syncing immediately.
evolu.create("todo", { title });
```

The last question is, when should we do that? We can expose an explicit sync
button, but that's not a friendly UX. The better approach is to use a reliable
heuristic to detect the user unit of work. We can leverage page visibility,
a route change, and other techniques. Unfortunately, we can't rely on unload
event because it's unreliable. **Evolu will release a helper for that soon.**
